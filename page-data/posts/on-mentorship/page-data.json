I’m grateful to have had so many life-altering experiences as both a mentor and mentee during this time, but not every connection lived up to its potential. As I think back on what worked and what didn’t, I’ve noticed four patterns rise above the rest.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"start-fresh-each-session\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#start-fresh-each-session\" aria-label=\"start fresh each session permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Start fresh each session</h2>\n<p>Lists like these typically start by mentioning the importance of goal-setting in the mentorship process, but this is only a half-truth: <strong>goals are only important insofar as they inspire action, and action requires excitement</strong>. Nothing will sap the energy out of a mentee faster than being assigned action items that they’re not excited to complete.</p>\n<p>While short-term goals are a great way to get your mentee moving, resist the urge to anchor your conversation around previously-mentioned goals or interests until you learn what your mentee has discovered about themselves since your last discussion. High-performers tend to have a variety of skills and interests, which means they’re likely to swing wildly from one passion to the next while discovering where they want to build their career.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The point of having goals is 80% to get us off of our asses and 20% to actually hit an arbitrary benchmark. The value in any endeavor almost always comes from the process of failing and trying, not in achieving.” <br /> - <a href=\"https://markmanson.net/surviving-my-20s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Mark Manson</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"keep-it-light-hearted\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#keep-it-light-hearted\" aria-label=\"keep it light hearted permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Keep it light-hearted</h2>\n<p>Out of respect for their mentors, high-performing mentees  may choose to put own interests on the backburner in an attempt to keep their mentors engaged. Mentee appeasement can come in many forms, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting goals that are more aligned with the mentor’s interest than the mentee’s</li>\n<li>Avoiding discussing fears or pain points to give the illusion of strength</li>\n<li>“Staying the course” even when the mentees’ interests and passions have changed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These tactics play on the mentor’s consistency bias, making them difficult to detect and correct. If left unchecked, these appeasement strategies will sap your mentee of their momentum and make it increasingly difficult to re-center the conversation around their actual interests during future discussions.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, there’s an easy way to prevent these behaviors: after every session, reassure your mentee that, wherever they happen to be in their personal and professional journey, they’re exactly where they’re supposed to be. This tone moves the conversation from a place of judgement to a place of development, offering your mentee the mental security they need to share, explore, and thrive.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“People have to believe that they’re in the absolute right place and time in their life before they can get reflective… They have to feel secure in themselves before they can do something great.” <br/> - A.K.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"name-their-fears\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#name-their-fears\" aria-label=\"name their fears permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Name their fears</h2>\n<p>It’s difficult for <em>anyone</em>, high-performers included, to realize when their insecurities are holding them back from accomplishing their goals. Taking my own experience as an example, I didn’t realize how afraid I was of entering the writing arena until a mentor called me out for publishing to my own personal website and not directly to my LinkedIn profile. Publishing to a hidden corner of the web wasn’t doing myself or anyone else much good, but it took an outside perspective from a trusted mentor to make clear that my fears were unjustified.</p>\n<p>Shedding light on our mentees’ fears is one of the most valuable things we can do as mentors.

These mentoring relationships are undoubtedly important, and many of my previous successes were achieved on the shoulders of similar platforms. The danger of these outcome-based relationships, however, is that they fail to achieve their transformational potential because their aperture is too small.</p>\n<p>In today’s connected world, it’s easy to find how-to guides for nearly every short-term goal. What’s much more difficult, however, is to find someone who is willing to sift through your thoughts and pull out life-changing gems that you didn’t realize were hidden below the surface. It’s these deep conversations that leave us fulfilled, yet we often spend our precious mentorship time reviewing documents and aligning on next steps. To facilitate those moments that your mentee will look back upon and appreciate, reframe your mentoring relationship around long-term fulfillment and mutual discovery. All it takes is one sentence to set the tone for future conversations:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“My main goal is to teach you things that will save you years down the line.” <br/> - A.K.</p>\n</blockquote>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/on-mentorship/","tagSlugs":["/tag/mentorship/","/tag/management/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-09-23T22:40:32.169Z","description":"Four principles for mentoring top performers","tags":["mentorship","management"],"title":"On Mentorship"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/on-mentorship/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","3613830147","401334301"]}
