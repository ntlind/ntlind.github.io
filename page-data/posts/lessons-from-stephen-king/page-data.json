After combing through his instructional “On Writing” for pearls of wisdom, I found that, like other great artists, Stephen is a master of habit. In this post, I explore five themes from Stephen’s life and lessons that have shaped the way I think about data science.</p>\n<h2 id=\"invest-4-6-hours-each-day-in-self-learning\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#invest-4-6-hours-each-day-in-self-learning\" aria-label=\"invest 4 6 hours each day in self learning permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Invest 4-6 hours each day in self-learning</h2>\n<p>Stephen’s prime directive is easy to write but difficult to follow:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>”<strong>Write a lot and read a lot</strong>… You don’t need writing classes or seminars any more than you need this or any other book on writing… I learned the most valuable (and commercial) part of my life’s work while washing motel sheets and restaurant tablecloths at the New Franklin Laundry in Bangor. You learn best by reading a lot and writing a lot, and <strong>the most valuable lessons of all are the ones you teach yourself</strong>.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To continue learning and growing as an author, Stephen devotes 4-6 hours each day for reading and writing. This outlay may not seem like much in the context of a professional workday but, if we’re honest with ourselves, it can be difficult to fit 4-6 hours of reading and coding around the usual barrage of scrums, pings, meetings, etc. Stephen and Munger would agree: even when devoting 4-6 hours to self-study isn’t feasible, it’s important to read and code for a few hours each day to continually <a href=\"https://fs.blog/2019/02/compounding-knowledge/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">compound knowledge over time</a>. If dedicated personal development time sounds like a chore, Stephen wouldn’t be apologetic:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“When you find something at which you are talented, you <strong>do it (whatever it is) until your fingers bleed or your eyes are ready to fall out of your head</strong>.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you’re looking for your next read, <a href=\"https://ntlind.github.io/posts/bookworms-guide-to-data-science/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">consider picking one off this list</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"charge-forward-while-the-idea-is-fresh\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#charge-forward-while-the-idea-is-fresh\" aria-label=\"charge forward while the idea is fresh permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Charge forward while the idea is fresh</h2>\n<p>Once Stephen decides he’s going to sit down and pen his next novel, he writes <em>every single day</em>; he doesn’t take any holidays or vacations until the first draft is complete:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>”<strong>Once I start work on a project, I don’t stop and I don’t slow down</strong> unless I absolutely have to. If I don’t write every day, … the work starts to feel like work, and for most writers that is the smooch of death. <strong>Writing is at its best—always, always, always—when it is a kind of inspired play for the writer</strong>.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With so many problems to solve and flashy libraries to explore, it’s easy to move distractedly from one project to the next until all that we have to show for our efforts is a dusty graveyard of GitHub repositories. To improve my completed/started ratio, I’ve resolved to devote 2 hours per ‘off-day’ to my latest passion project whenever one exists. There’s plenty of time to rest and recharge in-between sprints, but I’ve found I’m most restless when ideas are being left out to dry.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"write-v10-with-the-door-closed\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#write-v10-with-the-door-closed\" aria-label=\"write v10 with the door closed permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Write v1.0 with the door closed</h2>\n<p>Though I’d be surprised if Stephen ever set foot in an open office floor plan, he’d surely sympathize with those of us who have:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“It’s difficult for even the most naturally productive writer to work in an environment where alarms and excursions are the rule rather than the exception.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When he’s working on his next book, Stephen locks himself in his study and shuts out all potential distractions to ensure that every counted hour is productive. By forcing himself to concentrate on the task at hand to the exclusion of everything else, he’s able to complete his first draft as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>Even when we don’t have a private office in which to retreat to, we can still take steps to eliminate environmental distractions before firing up Visual Studio:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Search for unused conference rooms, empty deck clusters, or underutilized floorspace before settling-in</li>\n<li>Silence all electronic devices and messaging services (e.g., Skype, Slack) during periods of deep work</li>\n<li>Establish team norms and “office hours” to minimize interruptions while ensuring that everyone has access to the support they need</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"gather-actionable-feedback-from-others\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#gather-actionable-feedback-from-others\" aria-label=\"gather actionable feedback from others permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Gather actionable feedback from others</h2>\n<p>After finishing his first draft, Stephen lets his writing sit for several weeks before revising his work and gathering feedback from other writers (the most important of whom is his wife, Tabitha). Though he is a firm believer in the value of gathering others’ perspectives, he knows that not all feedback is created equal: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>”<strong>Non-specific critiques won’t help when you sit down to your second draft</strong>, and may hurt. Certainly none of the comments above touch on the language of your piece, or its narrative sense; these comments are just wind, offering no factual input at all.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Code reviews, the programming equivalent to distributed draft revisions, are similarly important but must be methodically conducted to be useful. <a href=\"https://www.kevinlondon.com/2015/05/05/code-review-best-practices.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Kevin London offers a great overview on specific flags to look for</a>, but the most common issue I’ve observed is that each review is conducted in a vacuum. By creating a team-shared feedback list to capture specific improvement areas by practitioner after each review, we can track development needs over time and offer both actionable recommendations and praise for personal growth.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"do-what-fulfills-you\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#do-what-fulfills-you\" aria-label=\"do what fulfills you permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Do what fulfills you</h2>\n<p>Stephen is successful because he genuinely loves to write: he is personally fulfilled by the time he spends putting ideas to paper, and he would (in fact, did) continue writing even if no one was paying him to do so:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I have written because it fulfilled me. Maybe it paid off the mortgage on the house and got the kids through college, but those things were on the side—I did it for the buzz. <strong>I did it for the pure joy of the thing. And if you can do it for joy, you can do it forever</strong>.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Stephen’s words resonated because I feel the same way about machine learning: I would continue spending 8+ hours per day reading and coding even if there wasn’t a way to use my knowledge to get paid. There’s something magical about using computers to creatively solve problems through the use of math and statistics; I can’t imagine doing anything else.</p>\n<p>It’s easy to get swept-up in the <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19161564\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">allure of “data science”</a> but, at the end of the day, it’s hard to build a successful career out of something that you aren’t genuinely interested in. To the aspiring consultants and data scientists out there: watch that MOOC, read that book, and try that Kaggle competition to explore your interest, but don’t force yourself into a career simply because it’s fashionable to do so. </p>\n<p>Whatever you end up doing, dive in head-first:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You can come to it because you want a girl to marry you or because you want to change the world. Come to it any way but lightly. Let me say it again: <strong>you must not come lightly to the blank page</strong>.”</p>\n</blockquote>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/lessons-from-stephen-king/","tagSlugs":["/tag/book-summary/","/tag/data-science/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-08-19T22:40:32.169Z","description":"What Stephen King's 'On Writing' can teach us about data science","tags":["book summary","data science"],"title":"Lessons from a Literary Giant"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/lessons-from-stephen-king/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","3613830147","401334301"]}
