Suddenly you find yourself giving similar pitches to similar clients with similar problems, yearning for the freedom to solve new challenges but unable to escape the politics holding you in place. I’ll dearly miss my friends and mentors at the firm, but putting my skin in the game feels like the surest way to optimize for personal growth.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The same mechanism of transferring risk also impedes learning… If you do not undertake a risk of real harm, reparable or even potentially irreparable, from an adventure, it is not an adventure.\"\"<br/> - Nassim Taleb</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"doubling-down-on-technical-challenges-within-retail--consumer-products\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#doubling-down-on-technical-challenges-within-retail--consumer-products\" aria-label=\"doubling down on technical challenges within retail  consumer products permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Doubling-down on technical challenges within Retail &#x26; Consumer Products</h2>\n<p>I’ve spent the past ~7 years learning as much as I possibly can about the intersection of software engineering, <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-the-mooc-a-bookworms-guide-to-data-science-e87271cb0572\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">data science</a>, and the Retail &#x26; Consumer Products (RCP) industries. <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3985421/market-share-analytics-and-business-intelligence-worldwi#:~:text=The%20overall%20analytics%20and%20business,platforms%20with%20a%2017.5%25%20growth.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Billion-dollar market estimations aside</a>, it’s obvious that there are huge opportunities hiding in plain sight within this subspace. $5B+ companies shouldn’t be running their businesses on Excel and 50+-year-old time series algorithms, but they’re limited by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hype-centric “AI” and “cloud” offerings that ignore business and user needs</li>\n<li>Lack of cross-trained business / software / statistics talent that is willing to engage with users, identify real use cases, and solve them sustainably</li>\n<li>Shortage of qualified engineers focused on B2B problems, even though <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1017421267031298050?lang=gl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">B2B offers some clear advantages over B2C</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Incumbent service providers know that these issues are holding the industry back, but they suffer from the exact same challenges as their clients. So too do most industry-born startups founded by former executives at IRI, etc.: industry and sales expertise are necessary, but not sufficient, to build a technology product that is 10x more usable and functional than anything else on the market. </p>\n<p>I don’t claim to have all the answers, but I’d bet that the next industry-shaking startup within RCP will look much more like Stripe than it will Nielsen. I’m excited to test this hypothesis over the next year to see if we can’t tackle some of these industry-wide problems from a new vantage point.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“In a way, every scaling startup is an experiment in empirical microeconomics research on ‘What parts of the typical corporate form are necessary and which are pageantry which we only keep around due to anchoring, the sunk cost fallacy, and tradition?‘” <br/> - Patrick McKenzie</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"minimizing-regret\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#minimizing-regret\" aria-label=\"minimizing regret permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Minimizing regret</h2>\n<p>After discussing entrepreneurship with dozens of mentors and senior executives over the past two years, I’ve been struck by how many of them wished they’d pursued their own venture at an earlier age. I can certainly empathize: <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/07/research-the-average-age-of-a-successful-startup-founder-is-45\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">waiting to start has its advantages</a>, but I’m not sure I’d have the risk tolerance and fortitude required to undertake this journey later in life given family considerations, lifestyle creep, and ever-increasing financial incentives. </p>\n<p>Given I too would harbor major regrets by ignoring this itch, it feels much riskier to take another product or management role at this stage than to spend the next two years building something new. Being able to code relieves much of the financial burden of starting a new technology company: I can keep my capital requirements near zero while searching for product-market fit. In the worst-case scenario, I’ll dip into my savings while uncovering dozens of hard-earned lessons that will make me a more empathetic leader, manager, and engineer in my next role. I can live with that.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Desire is insufficient.
