Stories of intelligent robots and artificial beings have pervaded our myths and legends since antiquity, sparking both excitement and fear as our ancestors considered the existence of autonomous machines. These myths continue to influence the narrative surrounding AI and, though we’re closer to developing artificial general intelligence than ever before, it can be difficult to separate fact from fiction given today’s buzzword-laden media.</p>\n<p>Though certain use cases have undoubtedly been overhyped, AI has the potential to transform every aspect of how we work, play, and live.

AI lives within the intersection of many classic disciplines, including philosophy, neuroscience, behavioral economics, computer science, and mechanical engineering. These interdisciplinary roots help explain why AI has captured our imagination: this burgeoning research field offers a little something for people of all interests and backgrounds. As we evolve our understanding of what AI is and how it works, we simultaneously make headway against the academic community’s most challenging research questions:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/750/1*bABBUt74m-y2ozzAQ55GCw.jpeg\" alt=\"Source: Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (2nd Edition)\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"business-implications\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#business-implications\" aria-label=\"business implications permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Business Implications</h3>\n<p>AI is certain to impact your career path over the next decade. Though most industries are still in the early stages of proof-of-concept (POC) development, many early adopters are already starting to enjoy the fruits of their labor. In one study, researchers found that F500 companies that proactively adopted AI technology have 3–15% higher self-reported margins than their competitors. These early success signals have triggered a wave of investment, motivating VCs and Corp. Dev. departments alike to spend tens of billions of dollars each year to develop and scale new AI capabilities. This funding has substantially increased the demand for data scientists and ML engineers, giving rise to new educational models (e.g., MOOCs, bootcamps) that support this virtuous cycle by accelerating the pace of AI adoption. No matter what role you play in our economy, you’ve probably already started to notice the effects of this wave:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/750/1*KYf9VU9YrTMD-iIYnhZWUA.jpeg\" alt=\"Sources: McKinsey Global Institute, Executive Office Report on AI, IBM Analytics Report, Venture Scanner\"></p>\n<p>It’s wise to approach funding statistics with a healthy dose of skepticism, and it’s unclear whether these same trends will continue in a bear market. Still, the momentum behind these trends suggests that AI will have a long-lasting impact on the business community.</p>\n<h3 id=\"societal-implications\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#societal-implications\" aria-label=\"societal implications permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Societal Implications</h3>\n<p>Outside of the office, AI will also have a far-reaching impact on our society. Though AI has the potential to expedite and improve our daily lives in ways that we haven’t yet discovered, it could just as easily be misused and abused. A few representative examples include:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/750/1*W1cmnkycpTcMgxXOiko5LQ.jpeg\" alt=\"&#x22;The proliferation of AI will have both positive and negative implications for our society&#x22;\"></p>\n<p>The concept of “Artificial Superintelligence” (known in research communities as artificial general intelligence, or AGI) is particularly divisive. Though we’re decades away from developing an autonomous agent à la Terminator or Ex Machina, many thought leaders have already started to debate the existential threat posed by superhuman AI. In one corner, Stanford professor and deeplearning.ai CEO’s Andrew Ng is optimistic about the role that AI will play in society:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“AI is the new electricity. Just as 100 years ago electricity transformed industry after industry, AI will now do the same.” <br/> - Andrew Ng</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the other, Tesla and OpenAI CEO Elon Musk argues for a much more conservative approach to AI development:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If I were to guess what our biggest existential threat is, it’s probably [AI]… With artificial intelligence, we are summoning the demon.” <br/> - Elon Musk</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Experts disagree on when we’ll finally achieve AGI, but, as we’ll soon illustrate, we’ve made significant progress towards this goal over the past few years.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"part-2-understanding-ai\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#part-2-understanding-ai\" aria-label=\"part 2 understanding ai permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Part 2: Understanding AI</h2>\n<p>In their 1995 classic <em>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</em>, Berkeley’s Stuart J. Russell and Google’s Peter Norvig broke AI into five distinct research areas originating from the Total Turing test:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Machine Learning</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Expert Systems</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Computer Vision</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Robotics</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Though the lines between each of these five disciplines has started to blur as we’ve made progress towards AGI, this framework serves as a helpful starting point for understanding AI. In this second section, we’ll offer examples and recent trends across each of these five disciplines.</p>\n<h3 id=\"machine-learning\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#machine-learning\" aria-label=\"machine learning permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Machine Learning</h3>\n<p>Machine learning (ML) is the science of <strong>empowering machines to make decisions</strong> without human intervention. This sub-discipline forms the backbone of AI, enabling computers to learn and interpret patterns in images, sounds, and structured data using multidimensional arrays. ML is further subdivided into four types of learning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Supervised learning</strong>: Given an array of features (i.e., week of the year, price, etc.) and a labeled output variable (e.g., sales), predict the best possible estimate of the label variable given some new input array.</li>\n<li><strong>Unsupervised learning</strong>: Given an array of features (e.g., demographic information, ZIP code, etc.), expose and visualize hidden relationships and anomalies within the array.</li>\n<li><strong>Semi-supervised</strong>: Given an array of features and a limited quantity of some labeled output variable, predict the best possible estimates for the missing label variables.</li>\n<li><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong>: Given some objective, train an artificial agent to maximize its utility according to some user-defined utility function.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Supervised learning is the most common form of ML used in the business world today, but that balance may shift as we continue to discover new use cases for the less traditional learning methods. An illustrative example of each learning type is offered below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/750/1*G8FmcUWcwn9u7m2iNimfrg.png\" alt=\"&#x22;Four subdisciplines of ML&#x22;\"></p>\n<p>Machine learning is to thank for many high-profile innovations over the past few years, but it’s more difficult to do correctly than commonly believed. If statistical best practices aren’t observed, ML models will overfit on previously-observed data points and lead business users astray. We’ll go deeper into this last point during a future discussion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"expert-systems\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#expert-systems\" aria-label=\"expert systems permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Expert Systems</h3>\n<p>An expert system (ES) is an <strong>artificial agent which leverages pre-programmed knowledge to offer advice or make decisions</strong>. In its simplest form, we can think of an ES as a complicated decision tree or nested if-then logic: if x, y, and w happen, we instruct the computer to do z. Though expert systems don’t enjoy the same hype as machine learning, there are many reasons why we might prefer an ES over ML:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An expert system can <strong>take advantage of human insights</strong> discovered through trial and error</li>\n<li>Expert systems are <strong>more predictable</strong> and are <strong>less likely to make extreme errors</strong> when faced with previously-unseen inputs</li>\n<li>Expert systems <strong>have historically been faster and easier to implement</strong>, though ML has become much more accessible in recent years</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"float-right\" style=\"width: 360px\">\n\t<img src=\"/media/nest.jpg\" alt=\"Google Nest\">\n\t<figcaption>Google Nest</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Expert systems are the most prevalent type of AI and are often incorporated along-side ML to help reduce the downside risk of errant predictions. Google’s Nest home automation technology is a prime example of an ES at work. Users program their preferences into Nest over time, enabling the system to automatically adjust housing temperature to desired levels and reduce heating expenses. Using ML to predict desired temperatures could lead to wild swings in settings and energy costs, so user-defined logic is critical to stabilizing these predictions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"computer-vision\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#computer-vision\" aria-label=\"computer vision permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Computer Vision</h3>\n<p>Computer vision (CV) is the <strong>automatic extraction, analysis, and interpretation of images or videos</strong>.
