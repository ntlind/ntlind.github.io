Even the best hedge fund managers, many of whom have devoted their entire careers to beating the market, are remarkably bad at it: <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/publication/more-evidence-that-its-really-hard-to-beat-the-market-over-time-92-of-finance-professionals-cant-do-it-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">less than 8% of hedge funds have beaten the market over the past 15 years</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.worth.com/what-the-hell-happened-to-hedge-funds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">average fund has underperformed market index funds by more than 50% since 2009</a>. What are the odds that your advisor can not only beat the market, but do so by a wide enough margin to justify their fees?</p>\n<p>Even if you do stumble upon an advisor who seems to outperform the market, it’s exceedingly difficult to know whether their streak is the product of luck or skill.  Jeremy Siegel said it best in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GWSXX26/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&#x26;btkr=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><em>Stocks for the Long Run</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If money managers choose stocks that have an expected return of 1 percent per year better than the market, after 10 years there is less than a two-thirds probability that they will exceed the average market return, and after 30 years the probability rises to only 74 percent. If managers pick stocks that will over the very long-run outperform the market by 2 percent per year, after 10 years there is still only a 77 percent chance that they will outperform the market… In these situations, the very long run will most certainly outlive managers’ trial periods for determining their real worth.”<br/> - Jeremy Siegel</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There’s nothing inherently wrong with placing your faith in another investor, but many people don’t realize that <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/091815/do-financial-advisors-get-paid-mutual-funds.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">their wealth manager may be earning fees or commissions off of their financial advice</a>. This perverse incentive, combined with the poor odds of picking a winning advisor, should make us wary about entrusting our funds to a paid professional. </p>\n<h3 id=\"trying-to-time-the-market-will-actually-hurt-your-returns-over-the-long-run\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#trying-to-time-the-market-will-actually-hurt-your-returns-over-the-long-run\" aria-label=\"trying to time the market will actually hurt your returns over the long run permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Trying to time the market will actually hurt your returns over the long run</h3>\n<p>Stock brokerages perpetuate the idea that you can make money flipping stocks but, in reality, you’re just making them rich off of your trade commissions. Timing the market correctly is extremely difficult (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/market_timing.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">if not theoretically impossible</a>), and <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/invest-on-your-own.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">the average investor underperforms the S&#x26;P index by 3.7% each year</a> in pursuit of unrealistic returns. </p>\n<p>Rather than trying to game the system, consider using <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">dollar-cost averaging</a> to diversify the risk of buying high and leaving your money untouched to accrue compounding interest over time. Where the emotional investor would pull-out their funds at the first sign of a disparaging headline, the savvy investor knows that the market is cyclical and, unless he/she needs the money immediately, a downturn represents a great opportunity to buy assets at a lower price. The patience to compound wealth over time is what separates the wealthy from the poor. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The worst course an investor can take is to follow the prevailing sentiment about economic activity.”<br/> - Jeremy Siegel</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"diversified-equity-investments-are-a-relatively-safe-place-to-park-your-money-for-long-holding-periods\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#diversified-equity-investments-are-a-relatively-safe-place-to-park-your-money-for-long-holding-periods\" aria-label=\"diversified equity investments are a relatively safe place to park your money for long holding periods permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Diversified equity investments are a relatively safe place to park your money for long holding periods</h3>\n<p>Many financial advisors will try to push you towards more aggressive trading strategies, but the experts agree that the index fund is the bedrock of modern investing.

This pattern suggests a systemic stability in the market that is likely to become even more stable over time as the global investing pool expands and diversifies.</li>\n<li>\n<p>For 20-year holding periods over the past 200 years, stocks have never fallen behind inflation (unlike fixed-income investments).</p>\n<figure class=\"float-right\" style=\"width: 360px\">\n<img src=\"/media/holdout.jpg\" alt=\"Standard deviation of returns decreases as holding period increases\">\n<figcaption>Standard deviation of returns decreases as holding period increases</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</li>\n<li>Stocks are risky in the short-term but relatively safe in the long-term; their standard deviation of returns tightens dramatically as your holding period increases </li>\n<li>Stocks may succumb to inflation in the short term but, because they’re intrinsically related to labor and capital, they’re “virtually immune” to the inflation rate over longer horizons.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Though we wouldn’t want to place all of our eggs in the index fund basket, Siegel’s findings reinforce Jack Bogle’s timeless advice:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Don’t look for the needle in the haystack.
